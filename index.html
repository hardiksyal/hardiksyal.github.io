        <h2 id="first">First post</h2>
       <p>
       My first post was on 24/04/2020. It was my dad's birthday. I was really extided about what I had done. When I posted it I was very keen to know hoe would people response and most imortantly what I had gain or will gain.

        <p>Then suddenly something excited happened which I didn't expected at all. My brother posted my blogs link on his instagram account and more and more people started admiring my blog although it wasnot that good but noone in my school was into these kind of things and everyone was kind of exited or amazed by my work this provided me good push to further polish my skills and show the world what I got. </p>
        
      <h2 id="journey">My Journey!</h2>  
      <p>
      My journey with computer science started way back when I was in 3rd standard when we all learn to use Microsoft office just to show that we were doing our school homework and when parents were gone we started playing games. 
      </p>

      <p>
          But my jounney with programming staryed in 8th standard when I first tought HTML though it was very basic but we enjoyed it very much but next year nothing much happned as computer syllabus for 9th got changed and we stuck with network, computer components and functioning.
      </p>
      <img src="http://conceptartworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/The_Art_of_Journey_11a.jpg" width="400" alt="jouney" class="center">
      <p>
      But 10th was life changing for me as I was introduced to machine learning with self made projects and was tought how to use diffret types of sensors. Though it was only block based coding but it made me think what else a machine can do.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how">How did I get in programming</h2>
      <p> 
         When I was in my junior year at my high school I had to choose between C++ and Python but due to unavailability of a Python teacher we choosed C++ it was such an intresting language that I will never ever regret using my time for learning that language it was a very wonderful experience and we were also able to learn SQL and it was very time consuming. After that I never stopped.   
      </p>
      <h2 id="every">Every Thing I Learnt</h2>
      <p>
      Till now I am 17 and 18 in few months from now and I will not say I have learnt alot but rather Ihave learnt very less as I thing I should have know till now. My main problem is that every thing I have learnt is not to an appriciable level I rather didn't got a chance or left the chance myself.

     <h3 id="python">Python</h3>
     <p>
     Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages today and is an easy language for beginners to learn because of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for Machine Learning and deep learning applications. Python is used to develop 2D imaging and 3D animation packages like Blender, Inkscape, and Autodesk. It has also been used to create popular video games, including Civilization IV, Vegas Trike, and Toontown. Python is used for scientific and computational applications like FreeCAD and Abacus, and it is also by popular websites like YouTube, Quora, Pinterest, and Instagram. The approximate annual salary of a Python developer is $92,000.

     <h3 id="java">Java</h3>
     <p>
     Java is one of the most common, in-demand computer programming languages in use today. Owned by the Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Window, Android, iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result of this capability, Java is recognized for its portability across platforms from mainframe data centers to smartphones. Today there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java.

   <p class="below"><strong>To learn more about Java Click on image above</strong></p>
<p>
Java is widely used in web and application development as well as Big Data. Java is also used in the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube. It is also extensively used in hundreds of applications. New Java frameworks like Spring, Struts, and Hibernate are also very popular. With millions of Java developers worldwide, there are hundreds of texts available for learning Java programming. Also, Java programmers are actively involved in a variety of forums where they vet ideas or solve programming problems. Java has a vast community and gets a lot of support.
</p>

<p>
Although Java is a more complex language to learn, the trade-off is experienced developers are in demand. The average Java developer earns around $94,000.
     </p>
     <h3 id="h">JavaScript and TypeScript</h3>
     <p>
      JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects inside web browsers. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is also used at the front end of several popular websites like Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon. Moreover, it is used in popular web frameworks like AngularJS, Node.js, and React.JS. The approximate salary for someone in this role is $72,500.

  <h3>C and C++</h3>
  <p>
  C and C++ programming languages, probably the first ones you learned, have been around for a very long time. C is still a widely popular general-purpose programming language that has influenced many other modern programming languages, including C++. Some people might argue that C uses more complex code compared to others, so what’s the use of C in this list? It’s one of the most fundamental languages in computer science, and learning it will make your basics clear.  
  </p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B"><img src="https://i.redd.it/31b2ii8hchi31.jpg" width="250" class="center"></a>
   <p class="below"><strong>To learn more about C++ Click on image above</strong></p>
  <p>
    Based on C, C++ is a powerful programming language that’s designed to take things one step further, and it offers object-oriented programming. It has established itself as one of the most important programming languages around. Just like C, C++ helps you gain an insight of how things work in computer science.
  </p>  
  <p>
    <strong>Applications of C and C++:</strong> These languages have been used to build numerous pieces of software, operating systems, desktop apps, mobile apps, web apps, game, game engines, etc.
  </p>
  <h3>Ruby</h3>
  <p>
    Ruby, a dynamic, general-purpose language, was designed and developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1990s, with a focus on the syntax that was easy to read by humans. This language supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative. This feature makes it a very flexible programming language.

   <p class="below"><strong>To learn more about Ruby Click on image above</strong></p>
  <p>
    Just like Python, it’s simple and readable. As a result, it’s widely regarded as one of easiest programming languages to learn. If you already know Ruby, you might be knowing that without any need to learn tons of commands and jargon, you can get started. Just like Python, Ruby also enjoys the love of its dedicated community. Ruby acts as a great tool if you need to deal with the backend aspect of your work. It’s widely used to develop websites, web-based applications, and mobile applications.

    <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> is a web framework built on Ruby. In recent times, we’ve seen a great rise in the number of Ruby on Rails job opportunities in new startups.<br><br>

<strong>Application of Ruby:</strong> As said above, Ruby on Rails is used to create web applications. Within a few minutes, one can create a web blog.
